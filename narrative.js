const initialNarrative = `
The world was a grid of rust and grey concrete, viewed through a film of grime on a third-story window. Below, the Veridia City East Freight Terminal hummed with the quiet, remorseless industry of a thousand robotic handlers and a handful of human overseers. Rain from the night before steamed off the asphalt under a weak morning sun. Cipher stood back from the window, a silhouette in the dusty gloom of the derelict office. The adrenaline from the hospital confrontation had faded, leaving a cold, sharp clarity.

Across the sprawling yard of stacked containers and skeletal cranes stood his target: the OmniCorp Depot. It was a fortress of clean, brutalist architecture, an island of ruthless efficiency in the terminal's grimy chaos. According to the emergent log, the Black Sun convoy had arrived fifteen minutes ago. Inside that depot, behind layers of steel and security, sat 'The Package'â€”a quantum-resistant decryption algorithm that could break the spine of the modern world.

*The 'Trojan Horse' strategy is viable,* Aura's thoughts integrated seamlessly with his own, a stream of pure data against the backdrop of his intuition. *Multiple cargo vehicles will be entering and leaving the depot. However, their security protocols are unknown. Blind infiltration carries a 78.4% probability of failure.*

He needed more information. The first move in a war of shadows is always to see, to know. To turn the enemy's fortress into a map of his own making. He considered the tools at his disposal, the tactical possibilities branching before him in the quiet air.

A set of options materialized in his internal vision, projected by Aura.

**[ACTION 1]:** Deploy the micro-drone for an aerial reconnaissance sweep of the OmniCorp depot.
<AURA_BRIEFING>
* **Objective:** Gather real-time visual intelligence on depot entry points, guard patrols, and the status of the Black Sun convoy.
* **Probability of Success:** High. The drone is small and the morning terminal activity provides excellent sensory cover.
* **Potential Consequences:**
    * **Positive:** Obtain actionable intel on layout and security patterns. Identify potential vulnerabilities or routines to exploit.
    * **Negative:** OmniCorp and Black Sun are high-security entities; active counter-surveillance is possible. Detection could compromise your location and escalate the \`city_security_alert_level\`. The drone's battery is limited, restricting flight time.
</AURA_BRIEFING>

**[ACTION 2]:** Use the Encrypted Datapad to probe the OmniCorp depot's local network for vulnerabilities.
<AURA_BRIEFING>
* **Objective:** Access security camera feeds, personnel rosters, and internal shipping manifests to digitally map the depot and pinpoint the algorithm's location.
* **Probability of Success:** Moderate. OmniCorp's network will be hardened. Your \`hacking_proficiency\` is \`intermediate\`, and their ongoing internal security audit presents both risks and potential overlooked openings.
* **Potential Consequences:**
    * **Positive:** Gain a comprehensive digital blueprint of the target location. Potentially locate the target asset without visual confirmation. Create digital backdoors for later use.
    * **Negative:** A failed hack would likely trigger a silent alarm, notifying OmniCorp security of an active intrusion attempt and increasing their digital defenses. This could also raise \`omnicorp.disposition_to_player\`.
</AURA_BRIEFING>

**[ACTION 3]:** Remain concealed and use this vantage point to begin formulating the specifics of the 'Trojan Horse' infiltration.
<AURA_BRIEFING>
* **Objective:** Use telescopic observation and tactical analysis to determine the most viable type of vehicle or container to use as a delivery vector.
* **Probability of Success:** High (for planning). Low (for immediate execution without more intelligence).
* **Potential Consequences:**
    * **Positive:** Develop a coherent, step-by-step infiltration plan, identifying necessary equipment and timing based on observable traffic patterns.
    * **Negative:** The resulting plan will be based on external observation only. Without drone or network intelligence, you risk basing the entire operation on assumptions that could lead to unforeseen traps or security measures.
